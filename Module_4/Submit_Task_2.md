# Rephrase the email

By the time you finish your call with the IT director, Henry has already replied to your email - and judging from the tone, he's not happy at all.

Until now, your relationship with Henry has been positive; he's responded well to the team's work, and has been open and collaborative in a professional context, if a little guarded about personal matters. This issue could jeopardise that relationship; it wasn't easy for him to secure the necessary approvals and funding to get support from a professional services firm to tackle the problems, so if there's a danger we've now created a new problem on top... well, that's not going to make anyone look good.

Think carefully about how to respond to Henry's note - and remember that people can be much more emotional and reactive when they're under pressure.

Q 1/6: Henry's opening line suggests frustration that the error has only just come to light - even though you told him almost as soon as you found out. How do you want to respond?
    
    A 1/6: Say that you'll check why the issue wasn't identified sooner.
    
Q 2/6: It sounds like Henry has personal worries today, alongside the professional issues. Do you want to acknowledge that?

    A 2/6: Ignore it - just say you can speak later when he's free.
    
Q 3/6: Henry wants to take the website offline completely, even though the problem seems to be focused on a single complaints category and you've already suspended outbound payments for claims which include items in that expense category. What do you want to do?

    A 3/6: Politely challenge him - point ou the PR implications and suggest suspending all the payments.
    
Q 4/6: Your attempt to calm his worries by estimating the potential size of the issue seems to have backfired; Henry's confused by your methodology. What's the best response?

    A 4/6: Explain it. 50% was your estimate of the absolute worst-case scenario.
    
Q 5/6: Henry asked you to contact Beth, the Media Relations team leader, to line up support in case it's needed. You don't know her, but it turns out to be a moot point; she's on leave today. Her deputy, Kenneth, answers the phone. How do you want to handle this?

    A 5/6: Delay the conversation and ask him to talk later.
    
Q 6/6: At the end of his email, Henry mentions your Managing Director, Jane Harrington. With everything that's been going on, you've not had time to call her - and when you try now, it goes to voicemail after a couple of rings. What do you want to say to Henry?

    A 6/6: Promise that you will send her a text and will be waiting for a reply.
