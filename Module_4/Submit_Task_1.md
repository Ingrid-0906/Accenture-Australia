# Fix the errors
### Work against the clock to spot the issues and errors in an urgent email to send to the client.
    Skills: Attention to detail | Error spotting
    
As you head towards the final weeks of the engagement, the team is monitoring the effects of the website UX changes, and refining the design of the management information (MI) dashboard.

One of your team members, Sandra, has spotted something worrying in the data. You need to investigate urgently, but you also need to let Henry know in the meantime.

You have a call scheduled with the IT team in two minutes - so Sandra has quickly drafted an email for you to send to Henry. You can't afford to miss the call with IT, but the email to Henry needs to go now.

Read through the source material to be sure you understand the situation, and then work quickly to review the draft email and spot any errors.
