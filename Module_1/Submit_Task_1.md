# Select Project Priorities

You're the team lead of a small Accenture project team which has just wrapped up a successful project at the Department for Student Support (DSS) - a national government department that is responsible for encouraging and enabling people to enter higher education.

The work has gone well, and your client has introduced your Managing Director, Jane Harrington, to one of her colleagues in another part of the Department; she was happy with our work, and thinks we could help her colleague with a new piece of work.

Jane called you a few days ago to provide some more information, and mentioned that she wants the team to start 'officially' working on the project next week. You've not heard anything more, until you get an email from her.

### Task Instructions

Before meeting Henry, you'll need to show that you understood his key priorities for the project, and that you have a plan to tackle them. To start, review the input materials again and identify which three priorities you think are best to tell the client will be your team's main focus.
