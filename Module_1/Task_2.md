## Assemble a plan

Now that you've identified the top three priorities, you need to think about how you can achieve them. Henry mentioned in his voicemail that he wants to talk through your plan for the six-week engagement... and that he was a little dubious whether a full six weeks would be necessary.

It's important that you can clearly explain the key activities which need to take place during this project, to give Henry confidence that you're using the time wisely. Focus on the main priority (identifying and implementing 'quick win' changes to improve the website UX) since the other two priorities can be covered as part of that work.

To help you visualise what the completed plan might look like, one of your colleagues has shared an equivalent plan from his own project's kick-off meeting. His plan relates to a consumer research project in Singapore and China, so the content is totally unrelated to your piece of work - but it may be useful to give you an idea of layout and style.
