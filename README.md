### Module 1 - Project priorities and Plan

This first module is focused on identifying project priorities, and developing a delivery plan to achieve them.

To complete the module you’ll need to consider a range of different information sources, from client messages to press articles, and decide which things the client will care about the most.

You’ll also need to take a practical approach to developing a simple, understandable plan – picking the right activities and putting them together in a sensible sequence.

    - 1: Set Project Priorities
    - 2: Assemble a plan
    Skills: Prioritising and Planning
    

## Module 2 - User Journal Design

Our second module focuses on the customer experience (CX) and asks you to make practical decisions based on client data.

To complete this module you’ll need to review the data sources and judge which user experience (UX) changes are the highest priority, in order to make a positive impact on the client’s website experience and performance. 

As you work through the module, make sure to keep the ‘end user’ top of mind; consider what a real person would be likely to expect, need and want from the website experience. You’ll need to use both your common sense and – just as importantly – the data to guide your decisions.

    - 1: User Journey Redesign
    Skills: Data Analysis and Assess Feedback
    

### Module 3 - Outcome Analysis

The third module focuses on extracting insights from data to respond to client questions about the performance of the changes you’ve made to their website.

You’ll need to review multiple data sources and interpret, extract and combine them to find the answers to their questions. 

As you go through this module you’ll experience the ambiguity and uncertainty you get on real projects – a client wanting an exact answer when you only have incomplete and inexact data. As you do this, think about the purpose and intention behind their questions, so you can select the responses that really give them what they need to know.

    - 1: Outcomes Analysis:
    Skills: Data Analysis and Client Communication
    
    
### Module 4 - Client Communication

Module four gives you the opportunity to think about how to communicate with clients in difficult situations, so you can identify and resolve problems in a calm and practical way. 

As you complete this module you’ll have to think about how relatively small differences in phrasing or precision can make a big difference to how people react to what you’re saying, especially when under some tight time pressure.

As with all these modules, the human factor is key.  As you’re working through it think about your client and how you’d react if you were in their position.

    - 1: Fix the errors
    Skills: Attention to detail and Error spoting
    - 2: Choose your language
    Skills: E-mail Communication
    
    
### Module 5 - Prioritisation and Impact Assetment

Our fifth module focuses on reviewing and prioritising a client’s ideas, to recommend a mix of short-term and longer-term initiatives that fit within their budget.

To complete this module you’ll need to use a consistent scoring process to assess and compare the ideas so they can be plotted onto a matrix. From here you can select the five initiatives most suitable for the client to prioritise for investment.

You’ll need to think carefully about your client’s requirements and how to make best use of their budget. Just like in real life, everything will require trade-offs and compromises.

    - 1: Prioritisation and Impact Assetment
    Skills: Strategic Thinking
    
    
### Bonus (MOdule 6) - Data Analysis and Dashboard development
Module six focuses on creating an automated analytics dashboard for the back office. The dashboard will balance key indicators tied to Customer Experience and Back Office Processing.

To build the dashboard, you will need to evaluate client needs, identify key performance indicators, and process available data.

You will deduplicate sets, process data to eliminate unnecessary elements, and match data to calculate six performance indicators. You will use Excel for data processing and Tableau for visualisation. As you complete the module, keep in mind the key problem you’re trying to solve for the client.

    - 1: Understanding the problem, and identify the KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
    Skills: Synthesising conflicting perspectives and prioritising performances indicators
    
    - 2: Review data and enhance quality
    Skills: Review and prepare data & Data Quality Enhancement
    
    - 3: Build a dashboard which answers the client's question
    Skills: Build dashboard and visualise data
