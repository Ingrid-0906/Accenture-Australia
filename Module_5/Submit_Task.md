# Prioritisation & Impact Assessment

Your team has agreed that, exactly as Henry suggested, you need to use a framework to assess and compare the candidate initiatives - and that the best approach is to assign each idea a score for 'ease' (5 = easiest and 1 = hardest), i.e. how straightforward it should be to undertake), and for 'impact' (5 = most impact and 1 = least impact), i.e. to what extent it has a positive effect on operating costs, effectiveness, or student/staff experience.
With these scores assigned, it'll be relatively easy to plot the initiatives onto a matrix - and then select an affordable mix of ideas from the top-scoring initiatives. Don't forget, too, that Henry wants a mix of longer-term strategic projects, and things which will deliver value in the near-term; this might be a little subjective, but you'll need to infer which initiatives fit into which category based on the descriptions.
