## Define the key performance indicators (KPIs).

You are in charge of preparing for a client kick-off workshop to develop the analytics dashboard. This will be our first meeting with Henry to discuss the key question of “How effective is our back-office capability for processing claims?” Your task is to identify the top three KPIs relating to Customer Experience, and the top three KPIs relating to Back-Office Processing.


- Customer Experience:<br>
    Claim-to-cash time (measured as time from submission to paying claims)

    Accuracy of payment (measured as % of claims reopened after closure to fix remittance)

    Net Promotor Score (measures student’s NPS upon closing each claim)


- Back-Office Processing:<br>
    Claims processed per team member

    Fraudulent claim payments ($ paid to claims that were later discovered to not have been eligible for rebate)

    Employee Satisfaction Score (measured weekly to gauge employee engagement)
